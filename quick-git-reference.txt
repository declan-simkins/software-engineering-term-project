For a quick guide: rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

To setup git repository in current directory: git init
To get a remote repository (after git init): git clone user@host:/project/path
  e.g: git clone git@gitlab.com:DecoSimkins/CMPT-395-Term-Project.git

Update local repository (not always clean): git pull
Update local cleanly (use before pushing): git fetch origin
                                           git rebase -p origin/<branch-name>

Add changed file to index (staging area): git add <filename>
  ^ Can be done to index deleted files as well

Add all changed files to index: git add *

Commit changes in index: git commit -m "Commit Message"

Send (push) commits to server: git push <server> <branch-name>

View local branches: git branch
View all (local & remote) branches: git branch -a
Create branch (locally): git checkout -b <branch-name>
Switch to existing branch: git checkout <branch-name>
Push branch to remote: git push <server> <branch-name>
Delete branch (locally): git branch -d <branch-name>
Delete branch (remotely): git push --delete <server> <branch-name>

Merge branch into current working branch (Should instead create merge request
  on gitlab website): git merge <branch-name>

In the case of conflicts, after they are resolved, mark them as merged by
  git adding them: git add <resolved-filename>
  (Again, merges should be done through gitlab)
